Big ideas:
 - samples get mixed in 8.24 fixed point (maybe?) @ 48kHz
 - samples get arranged in log2hz vs time space
 - samples can follow a curve in terms of speed vs time
 - frequency 


time: integer sample offset @ 48000 kHz, float would work

log2hz: integer 8.24 would work, float would be fine

sample: 8.24 would work, float [might] be fine


Usage:

- samples populate in left pane, click to preview/stop
- drag samples to main grid area, snap to time increments
- select several samples => block
- create reference block and snap to next measure
- CTRL+click / ALT+click to set loop bounds
- SPACE to play
- click to set play position (?)




Explicit integration:

\int_0^y 2^{ax + b} dx

2^{ax + b}
 = 2^b * (2^a)^x
 = 2^b * e^(log(2^a)x)

 2^b * e^(log(2^a)x) / log(2^a) <--- THIS

d / dx ( 2^{ax + b} )
 = log(2) (ax + b) 2^{ax + b}

TODOs:

 - sample library read directories + files
 - sample -> composition
 - play composition
 - (analysis)
